This lesson covers the playing sounds with _DirectX Tool Kit for Audio_ using 3D positional audio effects.

# Setup
First create a new project using the instructions from these four lessons to enable the audio engine for DirectX Tool Kit for Audio: [[The basic game loop]], [[Adding the DirectX Tool Kit]], [[Adding the DirectX Tool Kit for Audio]], and [[Adding audio to your project]]. We'll be using the result of that process for this lesson.
