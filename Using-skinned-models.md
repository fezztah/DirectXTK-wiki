In this lesson we learn how to render models using skinned vertices for smooth animations.

# Setup
First create a new project using the instructions from the previous lessons: [[Using DeviceResources]] and
[[Adding the DirectX Tool Kit]] which we will use for this lesson.

* Vertex skinning is also supported by [[SkinnedNormalMapEffect|NormalMapEffect]], [[SkinnedPBREffect|PBREffect]], and [[SkinnedDGSLEffect|DGSLEffect]] using the ``IEffectSkinning`` interface just as with ``SkinnedEffect``.

**Next lesson:** [[Using advanced shaders]]
